To participate, kids need to have access to a suitable computer and some peripherals. The goal of this page is to provide guidelines for parents on how best to support their kids on their learning journey. These guidelines are based on my personal experience and views.</p><h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2><p>The <strong>what</strong> is pretty simple:</p><p>My recommendation is to give kids access to the following after they complete elementary school at about the age of 10:</p><ul><li>a workplace at a desk, equipped with an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam, headset and a laptop or desktop computer</li><li>a personal smartphone with SIM card</li></ul><p>The <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> is not quite as simple.</p><p>There are many options for realizing this recommendation in full or partially. In any case, it is not only about equipment, it is also about the way of using it and how to set up the workplace.</p><p>Below I am discussing the reasons for my recommendation as well as some points that can help you with considering the available options and deciding on your own approach.</p><h2 id="status-quo">Status quo</h2><p>These days, many kids start using cell phones and tablets well before the age of 10. Observation shows two things:</p><ul><li>they become quite fluent at what they want to do without much or any training</li><li>they have limited or little understanding of fundamental concepts, other options that they might have and the advantages and disadvantages of each</li></ul><p>This is no surprise: phones and tablets are designed to make things as easy as possible. Very little understanding is necessary to get most things done. And kids are particularly good at picking up on the things that get them what they want. Like getting their fingers in the proverbial cookie jar üòÄ</p><p>Again, this is by design: nature has gifted the young with exuberant curiosity so that they can explore and learn the world they find themselves in.</p><h2 id="consumers-vs-creators">consumers vs. creators</h2><p>Smartphones and tablets are now part of the digital world we live in. But that part is typically very much designed to make it easy for us to consume content and services. Some software companies make efforts to bring some level of creative power to smartphones and tablets, for example for photo and video editing. And it is also true that one can push the limits of these devices to do more creative things. But their main focus remains clearly on consumers, not creators.</p><p>It is obviously a good thing to be able to get to information and use services as easily as possible. But an important part of the value of modern information technology comes from using it as tools for creating all sorts of things, including texts, media, models and software. And for these creative activities, the proper tool remains a personal computer with appropriate peripherals. Consequently, a tablet should not be the only nor the main computer we are using.</p><p>In the digital age, everyone should not only understand the fundamentals of information technology but also acquire the basic skills enabling digital creativity. As with any tool or instrument, becoming good at it requires time. I therefore recommend starting to use a personal computer as early as reasonably possible. And in my experience so far, kids at the age of 10 are usually perfectly able to take their first steps when learning under the right conditions.</p><p>To be clear: I am note arguing against smartphones. To the contrary: kids today should have smartphones because they play an important role in our digital world and kids are clearly able to use and benefit from them. For example, smartphones are extremely helpful for messaging and for authentication. Of course it‚Äôs true that there are risks and challenges involved, such as getting addicted to certain activities. But I recommend starting early and managing these risks and challenges and helping our kids manage them as well.</p><p>This prompts the practical question what kind of personal computer parents should obtain for their kids. This is in fact a rather difficult question and one important point is that many devices sold as personal computers are, much like tablets, meant to be used by consumers. They are insufficient as tools for many creative activities. And so below we‚Äôll try to provide some guidance on what kind of computers parents should get for their kids and why.</p><h2 id="the-right-tools-for-our-kids">The right tools for our kids</h2><h3 id="the-why">The why</h3><p>In our culture, literacy is a primary goal for our kids‚Äô education: to become proficient in spoken and written language and in using the relevant tools and techniques, like pen and paper. Literacy is not only a capacity to communicate but also to amplify the power of our minds.</p><p>Information technology extends and changes these tools and techniques considerably. And so we also need to adopt an extended notion of digital literacy. But being able to use a tablet does not mean that one has digital literacy. One can use a tablet very much like a display for books, without making use of the medium‚Äôs possibilies. And when not being able to put in side-notes, the corresponding literacy is actually poorer!</p><p>As a culture, we are still very much in the transition towards a mature digital age, with constant and sometimes revolutionary changes happening to the tools and techniques we use for communication, creation and collaboration. There is no fixed curriculum that schools could teach that would fully prepare students for the rest of their lives. The best we can do is to teach selected current tools and techniques and some fundamental skills, including most importantly the ability to acquire new tools and techniques on your own.</p><p>Nonetheless, digital literacy in its present form already takes years to acquire. Assuming that kids can start at the age of 10, they can spend between 5 and 8 years on it at school. Much like for traditional literacy that is enough to get to a certain level but it‚Äôs only really the beginning of a journey of lifelong learning.</p><blockquote><p>This is the first reason for giving our kids good tools for acquiring digital literacy. Good tools are a multiplier for the years of effort they put into this. There is no clear definition of what makes tools good. Having the most expensive tools may keep us from learning how to make do with less than optimal tools. One good example is that waiting on slow tools is mostly just wasted time. With better tools kids can achieve considerably better results with the same invested time and effort.</p></blockquote><p>People can start learning things at any age. But starting at about the age of 10 and spending the next few years on a topic has a distinct advantage. During that period it is much easier for a skill to become second nature and for the concepts and experiences to shape our way of thinking and our attitude. So making good use of that period can have a profound impact on whatever comes next.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, our kids are probably going to spend a lot of time in front of computers throughout their lives. This is definitely true when studying and especially true when choosing a profession that requires using computers. And more and more professions do.</p><p>There are a number of aspects we should be concerned about. As with everything else, we should try to <strong>minimize negative effects and maximize positive ones</strong>.</p><p>The most important negative effect concerns the <strong>health</strong> of our kids.</p><p>Obviously, kids need to spend enough time away from computers and be physically active. There are important physiological, psychological and social reasons for that.</p><p>But in this document we are concerned with how we can make the time that our kids <strong>will spend</strong> in front of computers as healthy as possible.</p><p>In terms of positive effects, as with any other tool, we should be concerned that our kids become and remain as productive as possible. We need to understand that we are talking about computers here as <strong>tools for the mind</strong>. They are tools for working with information, for learning, for exploring and expressing ideas, for engineering and for designing artifacts. That is to say that if we ask how our kids can be productive with computers, we always also ask how they can make good use of their minds. In fact, that is the more fundamental question!</p><p>Obviously, these are complex questions. And this document is not at all trying to provide complete answers. Instead, it is trying to raise a few relevant points and make a few <strong>simple recommendations</strong> that can already greatly improve the experience our kids have with using computers.</p><p>The first point is <strong>posture</strong>. To work in a concentrated but relaxed and healthy way, we need to sit with a certain posture, having the screen not too close and at eye-level or a little below, and resting our arms on the desk. Standing at an elevated desk is also good but not as the only option and so in this document we focus on sitting.</p><p>Laptops have many advantages. But sitting at a laptop on a table requires looking down at the screen and over time leads to fatigue of neck and shoulders. Writing on a laptop keyboard usually does not provide optimal arm support. Laptops should be used in this way when there is no other option but it should not be the default mode.</p><p>This is not a minor inconvenience but rather an important problem. Fatigue reduces concentration and productivity and so diminishes the results we get from the time and effort we invest. Moreover, continued bad posture can lead to serious health issues.</p><p>For using a laptop at one‚Äôs own desk, the minimal solution is to put it on a height-adjustable stand and use an external keyboard and mouse. This way an optimal posture can be achieved.</p><p>Moreover, even a large 17 inch laptop still has a much smaller screen compared to the now relatively inexpensive 24 or 27 inch external monitors. And this difference is usually even bigger because especially kids should not use large and heavy 17 inch laptops but rather 15 inch. This difference in size is important because working with modern high-resolution user interfaces for extended durations is much more strenuous on small screens.</p><p>A better solution is therefore to work with an external monitor and either use the laptop in clamshell mode, i.e. closed, or use it on a stand as a secondary monitor.</p><p>Good posture has many benefits for the body. But it has equally important benefits for the mind. When in a bad posture, being concentrated and productive is hard and becomes next to impossible after a while. The level of energy that one puts into the sitting posture is usually reflected in the energy that one brings to the task at hand. To put it bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>Who essentially is in a sleeping position at the desk will have great trouble bringing attention and creativity to the table.</p></blockquote><p>Good tools are not only about the computer. A good desk and chair can make a large difference in terms of comfort and effort required for working for a few hours.</p><p>Similarly, a desk cluttered with stuff and without enough space to work with books and papers will be distracting and a big obstacle to productivity.</p><p>Finally, a good working posture and attitude is a hard-learned and long-practiced habit. The earlier we provide our kids with a conducive work environment, the sooner they can acquire good habits and the more they can benefit from them on their learning journey. Moreover, the longer we wait, the more time and effort our kids will need to spend on getting rid of bad habits first. And this can sometimes be a difficult and painful process.</p><h2 id="example-of-a-good-work-environment">Example of a good work environment</h2><p>Here is an example of a work environment with a number of good aspects:</p><p><img src="/images/good-simple-setup.jpg" alt="good-work-setup"></p><p>Here is what you can see:</p><ul><li>an external monitor that is adjustable in position and height</li><li>a 27 inch screen that is big enough to allow working comfortably and productively with complex software</li><li>a screen that takes away as little space from the desk as possible</li><li>a webcam with good video and audio</li><li>a headset with good audio (I actually forgot to put it in, so please imagine it üòÅ)</li><li>a full-size keyboard with keys often missing form laptop keyboards</li><li>a mouse that is comfortable and precise</li><li>a desk offering space to comfortably rest the arms while typing; obviously a bigger desk is needed when working with other materials such as books; but the biggest desk is no good to us, if there is not enough space to properly use the computer</li><li>lighting, in this example there is enough light but it is not the best lighting as it also directly illuminates the screen</li></ul><p>And here is what you don‚Äôt see:</p><ul><li>distractions</li><li>a computer</li></ul><p>The key to having a good work environment is not a large desk. Stuff has a tendency to spread out and it requires a lot of discipline to keep things tidy on a desk. The key is to have <em>sufficient</em> storage <strong>in addition</strong> to and near to the desk. That way we can limit the things on the desk to what we really need. Sufficient storage does <em>not</em> mean just enough space for the current things. It means having at least a little more space than needed, so that we never have doubts where to put things, especially when in a hurry or under pressure. It also means having the right kinds of storage, so that it‚Äôs easy to put things away and also to find them again. There are many ways to do this. Everyone needs to experiment and find out what works best for them.</p><h2 id="laptop-vs-desktop">Laptop vs. Desktop</h2><p>We don‚Äôt need a desktop computer to work productively. A reasonable laptop is perfectly sufficient for most work. But as explained above that doesn‚Äôt mean that we should simply work <strong>at</strong> a laptop.</p><blockquote><p>If we have a choice, we should <strong>not</strong> work <strong>at</strong> a laptop! Instead, we can work with a laptop in a desktop setup with external monitor, keyboard and mouse.</p></blockquote><p>One consequence of this is that an optimal work environment does not only require a laptop. It ideally requires a laptop stand, external monitor, mouse and keyboard. Which is to say that it requires the peripherals that are also required for a desktop computer. This is an important point for comparing the cost of laptop and desktop options.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned in the beginning, a laptop for creative work needs to be more powerful than an entry-level laptop meant for consumer use. How much more powerful is a difficult question and depends heavily on the type of activity, its intensity and other factors. The point here is that a decent entry-level laptop that may cost around 700 Euro will be overwhelmed more or less quickly by more demanding creative work. This includes overheating and slowing down and thereby making work much less productive. Laptops able to handle creative workloads currently cost between about 1000 and 1400 Euro.</p><p>A particularly interesting new option comes from the company <strong>frame.work</strong> that offers a laptop for about 1200 Euro that has not only high performance but also is very reparable and upgradable.</p><p>It is not the point here to recommend buying a laptop in that price range. The point is to enable a more reasonable comparison between laptop and desktop computers. Because one can buy desktops for much less than a laptop of comparable performance. The entry level configuration that I would be recommending for a desktop provides considerably better performance for about 800 Euro than laptops in the mentioned price range.</p><p>Also, desktops provide more options for upgrading components to increase performance over time to meet growing requirements and extend the useful lifetime.</p><h2 id="new-vs-used">New vs. Used</h2><p>The prices mentioned above are for buying new systems. A more economical option is to buy used systems and potentially upgrade certain components.</p><p>Obviously this approach comes with limitations such as not getting the newest hardware or exactly your favorite components, requires a bit more understanding for choosing an appropriate system and potentially upgrading it, and it also comes with the usual risks of buying something used.</p><p>On the flipside, buying used can be much cheaper, can be a valuable contribution to making more sustainable use of resources, and make it much easier for the user to consider modifying or upgrading the system without the potential fear of tinkering with a brand new system.</p><p>All of the above points can be particularly relevant when getting the first computer for a kid to gather experience. Even if the kid eventually outgrows that first computer and it‚Äôs time to buy another one, the kid will probably have a better idea of what it wants and might even want to buy a used one again to spend less or get a better one for the same price.</p><h2 id="buy-vs-build">Buy vs. Build</h2><p>Another alternative to buying a new or used system is to buy new or used components and build a desktop computer yourself.</p><p>This requires more knowledge still and also comes with additional risks, for instance of compatibility problems or breaking things during assembly.</p><p>Therefore, if your primary goal is just to have a computer, don‚Äôt build it, just buy a complete system.</p><p>Instead, the primary goal of building a computer is to have a great learning opportunity. That is why I am currently preparing a MakeFest course for kids to build their own desktop computers. With proper guidance, this can be a relatively quick, safe and simple exercise.</p><p>On the technical level, you can learn about aspects of building a computer, like power, cooling, thermal conduction, and hardware interfaces for connecting memory, storage etc. And you can learn about the components, different options for them, relationships between them and their integration into a complete working system.</p><p>Especially for kids, learning how to actually put together their own computer from its components can be an eye-opening experience with practical as well as fundamental benefits:</p><ul><li>a reference for better understanding their computer during use by remembering their own hands-on manipulations when building it</li><li>increased confidence for doing repairs and upgrades on systems</li><li>increased interest for understanding how systems work</li><li>hands-on experience with a small-scale system that can serve as a model for better understanding more complex ones that we usually experience as black boxes, for instance modern infrastructure that we can rarely experience ourselves, like cloud services provided by data centers</li><li>it can inspire confidence for handling issues, for solving problems, and for dealing with the unknown, all with healthy respect but without unwarranted fear</li></ul><p>This is a <strong>fundamental</strong> benefit. Namely because confidence should not be rooted in knowing how to do something but in the experience of figuring something out that we did not know how to do at first.</p><p>I am not arguing here that it is important to learn how to build or repair everything. That is neither possible, nor practical, nor desirable.</p><p>It can be very valuable to reduce and manage complexity to think in terms of black boxes and consider them the responsibility of someone else. In fact, it is important to learn to negotiate and define such sharing of responsability to become productive in a group.</p><p>But it is also valuable and indeed very important to be confident about opening black boxes, looking inside, figuring them out, and sometimes taking over responsibility for them, if the situation calls for it.</p></div></div></div><div class="text-gray-med-darker flex flex-row gap-5 justify-center p-10 flex-wrap"><a href="/contact" class="dark:hover:text-gray-500 dark:active:text-gray-200">Kontakt &amp; Impressum</a><a href="/terms" class="dark:hover:text-gray-500 dark:active:text-gray-200">Nutzungsbedingungen</a><a href="/privacy" class="dark:hover:text-gray-500 dark:active:text-gray-200">Datenschutzrichtlinie</a></div></body></html>
