This should be the <strong>main goal of education</strong>, or at least one main goal.</p><p>Through school and university, students often acquire an impressive body of knowledge but many <strong>lack skills for applying and extending their knowledge to deal with actual problems</strong>.</p><p>The MakeFest courses have been designed for participants <strong>to develop problem-solving skills</strong>.</p><p>To this end, <strong>each course is a project with concrete goals that participants try to reach by collaborating as a team with the support of an experienced coach</strong>.</p><p>In terms of content, the current courses are about <strong>game development</strong>.</p><p>But developing games is not the primary objective. It is a vehicle to <strong>engage participants in an interactive, interdisciplinary, enjoyable and rewarding collaborative activity that provides context and motivation to apply and extend knowledge in a meaningful way</strong>.</p><p>Participants do learn programming and related development and design skills. But more importantly, by making a long sequence of small constructive steps, they learn about and practice whatever it takes to reach the project goals, including:</p><ul><li>framing problems</li><li>charting a path towards the project goals</li><li>identifying what they know and don’t know</li><li>finding information to fill gaps in their knowledge</li><li>communicating and collaborating with others</li><li>taking initiative and responsability</li></ul><p>In this context you can <strong>think of the games as concrete opportunities for going from idea to solution in a way that provides direct feedback in the form of enjoyable interactive experiences.</strong></p><p>Going from idea to solution through a sequence of constructive, enjoyable and collaborative steps - <strong>that’s why it’s called MakeFest!</strong></p><p>The role of the coach is not to lecture on some topics but to engage and guide the participants in their exploration of questions, artifacts and approaches relevant to taking the before mentioned steps toward their project goal. To this end, the coach provides just enough information and support <strong>so that participants can solve the given challenges as independently as possible</strong>.</p><h2 id="format">Format</h2><p>Currently courses take place online, using video-conferencing, screen-sharing and other services for exchanging information.</p><p>The initial format for each session is a rapid succession of the following steps: first, the group discusses the next step to take and then each participant carries out that step one after the other on her or his computer while sharing the screen.</p><p><strong>This has proven to have the following benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>it stimulates attention to be prepared for when it’s your turn</li><li>it enriches learning by seeing how and what the others are doing</li><li>it increase retention through repetion</li></ul><p>Based on the complexity of the given step and the experience of each participant, the group will eventually deviate from this standard format and start carrying out more steps in parallel. This is done in the interest of increased speed but there is always the option to share with the group whenever a particpant or the coach feels it would be helpful.</p><p>As a byproduct of this course format, participants also learn how to make effective use of computers and online services for communication and collaboration.</p><h2 id="prices">Prices</h2><p>Prices depend on the length of the course and the level. Most courses run for half a school year and each such course is at about 680 CHF incl. VAT per participant. The maximum number of participants per course is 10.</p><h2 id="requirements-audience-and-program">Requirements, audience and program</h2><p>So far, there have been 14 MakeFest courses with both girls and boys between the ages of 10 and 13. There are courses for all levels, including absolute beginners.</p><p>The technical requirements are the following:</p><ul><li>computer with either Windows, MacOS or Linux</li><li>webcam and headset</li><li>ability to install software</li><li>e-mail account</li><li>internet connection fast enough for video-conferencing</li></ul><p>The exact content for each course is agreed upon with the participants based on individual interest and experience. Below is a general list of topics with increasing difficulty that individual courses may target.</p><p>10+ years</p><ul><li>introduction to programming (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">c#</a>) and game development (using <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a>)</li><li>advanced programming and game development (various topics)</li><li>3d modeling (<a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>)</li></ul><p>13+ years</p><ul><li>collaborative development (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>)</li><li>advanced programming and game development (various topics)</li><li>finding and using relevant research publications</li><li>defining research questions and conducting scientific investigations</li></ul><h2 id="coach">Coach</h2><p>The coach has studied Computer Science, Physics and Philosphy in Hamburg, Germany and Bordeaux, France.</p><p>He spent 3 years in commercial software development before heading a research group at a Fraunhofer institute in Germany for 10 years. At his time at Fraunhofer, he acquired and headed six EU research projects, collaborating with companies and research organizations all over the world with a focus on simulations and emergency response. During these projects, he also supervised various master theses.</p><p>Since moving to Geneva in 2010, he has been a visiting researcher at the University of Geneva and then acquired and directed an international development project on advanced personal protection systems.</p><p>In 2016 he founded the company SimHub Ltd. where he is developing simulations for emergency response training and other applications.</p><p>In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, he started the MakeFest courses to provide an opportunity for students at the German School in Geneva, including his daughter, to make better use of their computers, become better problem-solvers and do projects together even if they could not meet in person.</p><h2 id="courses">Courses</h2><p>See <a href="https://makefe.st/courses/">here</a> for a list of current and upcoming courses.
